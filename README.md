PyBer Analysis

Analysis Overview
-----------------
  The purpose of this analysis was to conduct exploratory data analysis for PyBer, a ride sharing company, in an effort to improve access to ride sharing services across all neighborhoods. The focus was on ride sharing data related to city types – urban, suburban, and rural – and the rides, drivers, and fares across them. 

Results
-------
  The data related to overall ride and total drivers was skewed towards the urban geographic region, with suburban and rural coming in second and third place, respectively. This, of course, would be expected given that urban areas tend to be more heavily populated and would have a higher demand for ride services.

Summary
-------
  Based on this analysis There are three business recommendations that I would make:
  
    1.	Increase total drivers in the rural geographic region – this area has the highest average fare per ride which is good for PyBer but expensive for the customer which could dissuade some patrons from using the service. Increasing supply of drivers would lower the ride cost and may increase demand for the service. From the driver’s perspective, this area also has the highest average fare per driver. 
    2.	Increase drivers in the suburban geographic region – this area has the second highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. The basis for this recommendation is akin to the increase in drivers for the rural areas. 
    3.	Decrease the number of drivers in the urban geographic region. This area is exhibiting saturation by having an average fare per driver lower than the average fare per ride. Additionally, there are 1.5 drivers for every rider – by decreasing supply of drivers, you will be able to increase the per ride/per driver data.
